# Hyperswitch HTML + PHP Integration

Build a simple checkout form to collect payment details. Included are some basic
build and run scripts you can use to start up the application.

## Running the sample

1. Add your keys :
    - Navigate to `public/script.js` and replace the placeholder `HYPERSWITCH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your publishable key.
    - Navigate to `secrets.php` and replace the placeholder `HYPERSWITCH_API_KEY` with your API key.

2. Run the server :
~~~
php -S 127.0.0.1:4242 --docroot=public
~~~

3. The sample app will now be accessible here : [http://localhost:4242/index.html](http://localhost:4242/index.html).
